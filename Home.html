                     <p>To learn all about who I am!</p>
                     <p>I hope to have some good stuff here one day but alas I am very new at making these types of things. What I have learned so far is so minimal but it is still facisnating to see the endless
                     possibilities that html, and CSS have to offer.</p>
                     <br>
                     <p> Being creative is a passion of mine and I like to explore new avenues every day, these tools I have learned have given me a way to funnel
                     my imganition in a real tangible way and to explore and play around with the limitations which I break everyday.</p>
