      I was born into an easy life but it got hard when I had to work at taco bell. The depression of the people around me was astonishing
      due to the simple fact I had yet to suffer such emotion before. I had only known happiness and this crushing new weight that filled the
      environment around me, made me come to the realization that life thus far had been a padded bubble wrap where my parents simulated a joy ride
      in which I had cruised along with neither thought nor care as to the future which came sooner rather than later.</font>
