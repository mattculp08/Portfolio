    <div id="amtext">
        <p> I was born in provo hospital on December 11, 1998</p>
        <p> I have brown hair, brown eyes, and I am 6 feet tall.</p>
        <p> I enjoy doing many things in my free time (which I now seem to have a lot of) including but not limited to: listening to music, playing video games, hanging out with friends, and video editing on sony vegas.</p>
        <p> I am a night owl and would rather stay up all night then be awake in the day, I also have a passion for urbam cultures and cities and hope to one day live amongst the buzz and wonder of a metropolis.</p>
        <p> I also work part time at Taco Bell and I love it! Live Mas. </p>

        <br>
        <br>


    <p>I am the youngest of 5 children consisting of one brother and three older sisters whom I love dearly. I have four cats as pets and they all are equally annoying and cute. I also have a passion for running if I ever get off the couch.

I don't like to be alone and if there is an opportunity I will try to surround myself with noise or people, I am also tired by nature and am always looking for a nap if I get a chance.

I have always talked about wanting to learn programming and actually make things out of code and now I finally have a chance to dip my foot in the water!

That was about me! <a href="Contact.html">Contact me</a> to find out more, I hope to see from you soon!</p>
